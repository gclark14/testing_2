So how do branches work?
Well, we know some things about 'em. Branches are different dimensions in a project??
Sorta.
Projects give us different snapshots of the same project. Each person can 
have one, even your grandmother is entititled to one. Recall the .0 .1 
extensions we can add to our files to give em different editions?
This is the same thing. If you want to break your project, break the 
snapshot, not the actual project. 
If you commit to a project in branch 'login', master's copy of changed files
are not affected. When you merge, that's when master gets updated to have 
what develop had. 
// IF YOU DON'T COMMIT
If you have two branches with access to the same directory and you delete 
one of the files in that directory, both branches will lose the files. 
// IF YOU DO COMMIT
So, you may add files to a directory with mutliple branches, if you don't 
commit to a particular branch then you can expect the file to be accessible
across those branches. WHEN YOU COMMIT, you are COMMITING THAT FILE to THAT
BRANCH. It's marriage. And it doesn't fall into the 51% - thank you.
IF you hop out of the terminal and hop back in, status is saved.
